Sentiment analysis, which is also known as opinion mining, is one of the major tasks of NLP. It studies peopleâ€™s sentiments towards certain entities and detects polarity (e.g. a positive or negative opinion) within text. Sentiment analysis is often used in business to detect sentiment in social media, evaluate brand reputation and understand customers.
